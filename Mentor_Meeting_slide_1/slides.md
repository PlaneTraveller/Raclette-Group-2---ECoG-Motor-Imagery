## Movement 

### Task

- interval based, hand/tongue/rest according to visual cues

### Data

- Power potential density of ECoG potential from all electrodes

- Low-freq band (LFB) & High-freq band (HFB)



### Analysis
#### Overlap metric

- A. the role of High frequency band and Low frequency band in imagery may be different
imagery and actual movement share more similar characteristics in low frequency band than in high frequency band
- B. detailed information about the overlap results in each participant
similar pattern to the group mean (see figure 1)

- An experiment was done with 4 subjects in an imagery-based learning task to control a cursor on screen using particular electrodes from previous movement task experiment



---

### Figure 3A
- Electrode-Frequency combination of gold electrode, 79-95Hz, around primary tongue cortex

- Measured power P(t) then used control a cursor (its velocity) with simple linear equation, evry 40ms from P(t) during the previous 280ms in respect to mean power Po
- Imagery done by “imagining” saying the word move to move the cursor as active target, and just rest (doing nothing) as passive target

# Figure 3B
- During 4 consecutive run, red dot indicates active target, blue dot passive target, green line indicates Po, mean power across passive/active trials
- Accuracy increases for every run with the highest one at run 4
Of particular note, subject reported ceased to perform imagery, and “just thought about moving the cursor up and down to move”

# Figure 3C
- Activations of LFB & HFB across all electrodes were shown, with increasing activation in the corresponding area (tongue cortex) & frequency (HFB) throughout the trials with run 4 being the highest

# Result
## Nan Chen

1. the spatial distribution of local neuronal population activity during **motor imagery** **mimics** the spatial distribution of activity during **actual motor movement**. 

2. The role of **primary motor areas** in movement imagery was revealed by significant imagery-induced cortical surface activity at electrode sites where electrocortical stimulation produced movement. 
   	The magnitude of imagery-induced cortical activity was **∼25%** that of actual movement. 	
   	When this same imagery was used to control a cursor in a simple feedback task, we found an **augmentation** of spatially congruent cortical activity, even **beyond** that found during movement.

3. spatial distribution
